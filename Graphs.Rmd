Graph and save lots of graphs on all regions present, paginated by by size of the Covid impact 
(total confirmed cases), and on each page, territory graphs are sorted by decreasing value of the first graphed variable on the latest date in that territory.
Make aand save all graphs, make sure the paths are correct!

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:


Note that the `{r, echo = FALSE}` parameter can be added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
