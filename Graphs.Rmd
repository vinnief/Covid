Run loadData.R or output.Rmd first to load the latest Data and the definitions. 
Please make sure myPlotPath is correct!

```{r, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)

if (!exists('JHH')) source('loadData.R') else 
  if (max(JHH$Date) < Sys.Date() - 1) {source('loadData.R')  
   } else source('definitions.R')
switch(get_os(), 
       windows = {print("I run MS Windows.");myPlotPath <- "G:/My Drive/Covid19_plots"},
       linux   = {print("I'm a penguin."); myPlotPath <- "~/Covid19_plots"},
       osx     = {print("I'm a Mac.");myPlotPath <- "~/Covid19_plots"},
       ...     = {print('not recognized OS');myPlotPath <- "~/Covid19_plots"})

if (!dir.exists(myPlotPath %//% 'data')) dir.create(myPlotPath %//% 'data', recursive = TRUE)

```

Graph and save lots of graphs on all regions present, paginated by size of the Covid impact (total confirmed cases), and on each page, territory graphs are sorted by decreasing value of the first graphed variable on the latest date in that territory.


```{r , echo = FALSE} 

tim = Sys.time()
walkThrough(lpdf = ECDC, regions = ECDCRegios, graphlist = myGraphNrs, myFolderDate  = 'current', ordre = 'GR')
reportDiffTime('ECDC graphs',tim, units = 'mins')

tim = Sys.time()
walkThrough( lpdf = JHH, regions = JHHRegios, graphlist = myGraphNrs, myFolderDate  = 'current', ordre = 'GR')
reportDiffTime('JHH graphs',tim,units = 'mins')
``` 

Development one month at a time
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
walkThrough(lpdf = JHH, regions = JHHRegios, graphlist = myGraphNrs, from = "2020-01-01", to = '2020-01-31', myFolderDate = 'January', ordre = 'RG')
walkThrough(lpdf = JHH, regions = JHHRegios, graphlist = myGraphNrs, from = "2020-04-01", to = '2020-04-30', myFolderDate = 'April', ordre = 'RG')
walkThrough(lpdf = JHH, regions = JHHRegios, graphlist = myGraphNrs, from = "2020-06-01", to = '2020-06-30', myFolderDate = 'June', ordre = 'RG')
walkThrough(lpdf = JHH, regions = JHHRegios, graphlist = myGraphNrs, from = "2020-07-01", to = '2020-07-31', myFolderDate = 'July', ordre = 'RG')
```

do all months up to today
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
verbose = 1
makeHistoryGraphs(JHH, regions = JHHRegios, fromDates = seq(as.Date('2020-01-01'),Sys.Date(),  by = '1 month'), ordre = 'GR')  
makeHistoryGraphs(ECDC, regions = ECDCRegios, fromDates = seq(as.Date('2020-01-01'),Sys.Date(),  by = '1 month'))  

```
A more convoluted way: 
```{r eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
startDate = "2020-01-01"
fromDates <- as.character(seq(as.Date(startDate), length = 12, by = "1 month"))
toDates <- as.character(seq(as.Date(fromDates[2]), length = 12, by = "1 month") - 1)

makeHistoryGraphs(ECDC,ECDCRegios, graphlist = myGraphNrs, 
                  fromDates = fromDates, toDates = toDates)

makeHistoryGraphs(JHH,JHHRegios, graphlist = myGraphNrs, 
                  fromDates = fromDates, toDates = toDates)

```
This do once in a while, to do all the non-numbererd graphs. 

```{r byDate once a week}
if ( weekdays( Sys.Date() , abbreviate = FALSE) == "Friday")  
  walkThrough(JHH, JHHRegios[1:10], graphlist = myGraphListbyDate,
              myFolderDate = 'weekly')
```

Simulate how the non-social distancing situation would have turned out: deaths, recovered, and confirmed   
```{r sims , eval=FALSE, include=FALSE}
graphDddp_fyl(JHH,regios$Vincent,savename  = "deaths missed") 
walkThrough(JHH, regions = JHHRegios,graphlist = 'graphDccprr_fyl')

walkThrough(ECDC, ECDCRegios,ext = '_sim', graphlist = c('graphDccprr_fiyl','graphDddp_fyl')) 
walkThrough(ECDC , ECDCRegios,ext = '_endsim',graphlist = c('graphDccprr_fiyl', 'graphDddp_fyl')) 


```
## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

Note that the `{r, echo = FALSE}` parameter can be added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
