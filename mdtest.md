__how are we seeing this, bold?__ we made it with two underscores glued to the text on both sides. 

* italic? this? no, the asterisk with a space converts into a list item
* *italic is between two asterisks,* no spaces between the asterisks and the text please! otherwise the underline (plain text markup for italic) continues. _italic again, now with underscores_

**? two asterisks should be bold**

__two underlines as well.__ again, don't forget not to add spaces between the text and the __

and this then is normal text.
